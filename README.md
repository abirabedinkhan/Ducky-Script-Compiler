# Ducky-Script-Compiler
Ducky Script is the payload language of Hak5 gear. Since its introduction with the USB Rubber Ducky in 2010, Ducky Script has grown in capability while maintaining simplicity. Aided by Bash for logic and conditional operations, Ducky Script provides multi-vector functions for all Hak5 payload platforms.
